(/) Remove tree_manager as arg from calendar_manager classes and replace all
    with a filter_manager arg
(/) Similarly remove the filterer arg from all manager classes and just get
    it from the filter manager
(/) Add most of the introductory tree_manager property and utility functions
    as just manager base functions for all to use if needed
- Then start building up the filter manager as class
- And add back the specific filtering methods required for each of history,
    tracker etc etc.

- fix uses of managers, specifically in outliner (still need a tree_manager
    there, but I'm thinking now we should be able to just get one tree_manager
    and vary up the filter_manager) - will need to change it in a bunch of
    models too
- check how (if at all) this change effects the hybrid views. Again, so long
    as we have a distinct filter_manager for each tab then I think having
    just the one schedule/planner manager should be fine, but may need to
    make sure of that

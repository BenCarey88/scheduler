- Remove tree_manager as arg from calendar_manager classes and replace all
    with a filter_manager arg
- Similarly remove the filterer arg from all manager classes and just get
    it from the filter manager
- Add most of the introductory tree_manager property and utility functions
    as just manager base functions for all to use if needed
- Then start building up the filter manager as class
- And add back the specific filtering methods required for each of history,
    tracker etc etc.
